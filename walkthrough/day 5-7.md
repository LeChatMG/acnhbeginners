# Tasks
## Campsite


Now you should have 5 villagers! This is your 2 starting villagers and 3 plots you built. After everyone has moved in to the island Tom Nook will give you the campsite building kit. This is where every often a Camper will come and you can potentially make them move to your island! Find a spot to build the campsite and press <span class="icon-A"></span> and you will have 2 options:
- Imagine it
- This is the spot


Similar to building bridges "Imagine it" will show you how the campsite will look in that spot and "This is the spot" will place it! The first Camper will be your 6th villager!
{: .note} You may have to wait a few days before you see a camper pop up in the campsite! Tom Nook will announce when you have a camper in your campsite.

- Does the first camper have to move in to my island?
  - Yes they do! No matter who the first camper is they will have to move in, but don't worry if you want you can get rid of them later! See [here](https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/moveout.html) for how to get rid of them!

See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#how-often-does-someone-visit-my-campsite) for more information on the campsite!

## More Villagers


Now the next step is to get 2 more villagers to move in to your island! -- **needs to be finished**
## Upgrading the Resident Services


The Resident Services is the tent that you go to talk to Tom Nook at the moment! To activate the upgrade you need to have built the Nooks Cranny and have 8 villagers! See [above](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%205-7/#more-villagers) for more villagers and [Day 4](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%204/) for more guidance on the Nooks Cranny.
