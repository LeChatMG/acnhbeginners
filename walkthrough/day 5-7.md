# Days 5-7
Welcome to Days 5-7! The following days will be clumped together as there is much less structure and these objectives can be completed any time before the end of the week. Before proceeding, please make sure you've completed the following objectives:
- Crafted and placed your first bridge
- Placed and furnished three plots

If you have not completed any of this please see [Day 4](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%204/) for further guidance.

# Tasks
## Customization workshop
- Now that you've furnished the plots, Tom Nook should make an announcement about his **customization workshop**. Customization allows you to change the look of some items.
  - *Note:* Not every item is customizable.
- Customization is relatively straightforward, all you need to do is bring the **item you want to customize** and the required number of <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/RemakeKit.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **customization kits** to a workbench and select `Customize Something`.
- Tom Nook will give you <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/RemakeKit.png" id="inv-icon"></span> **50 customization kits** for you to use and experiment with.

## Harvey and his island
- In the next couple days you might see a hippie dog <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcIcon/spn.png" id="inv-icon"></span> walking around your island. Talking to him will prompt him to introduce himself as Harvey (Harv for short) and invite you to visit his island.
- Harv's island is also home to his photo studio, called **Photopia**, and you can use that building to stage photos for fun.

{: .note}
Harv's island is also where you obtain **villager and special character posters**. You can do this by spawning your villagers into Photopia (select the tab with the cat head on it when in design mode), or by scanning in a villager/special character's [Amiibo](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#what-are-amiibos-who-has-an-amiibo). Even if the game complains said character can't come to Photopia, this still unlocks the corresponding poster.

## Upgraded Resident Services and Isabelle
- When all 3 of your brand new villagers have moved in, Tom Nook will make an announcement that he is upgrading the Resident Services tent into a building -- hooray! 
- There's nothing you have to do to proceed with this, but the building will be down and inaccessible for a day. If you have an ABD streak, it will not be affected by the construction day, so don't worry about losing your miles.

### Isabelle
- Isabelle <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcIcon/sza.png" id="inv-icon"></span> is an NPC you meet once the upgrade of the Resident Services is complete. Tom Nook will introduce her during announcements and explain that she will take some of his responsibilities.
- Isabelle also adds some new options for you. Visit [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#isabelle) to learn more about Isabelle and what she does. 

### Construction counter 
- You now have access to Tom Nook's **Construction Counter**. By sitting in front of Tom Nook's desk, you may now:
  - Ask to build inclines
  - Ask to build ramps
  - Ask to move buildings (everything except the Resident Services building and airport can be moved)

## Able Sisters

<!-- tentative organization for now. -->
# Project K
- The activation of this quest signals the tail end of the tutorial. Once you have finished this quest, the tutorial will be over and you will not have any more quests given by Tom Nook to complete.
- Speak to Tom Nook at the construction counter and ask him "What should I do?". He will explain that he has a vision for the island, and that he would like to invite [K.K. Slider](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#kk-slider) <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcIcon/tkkA.png" id="inv-icon"></span> to perform on your humble island.
- Project K is split into three phases, all of which need to be completed in order for K.K. Slider to visit:
  1. Build a Campsite
  2. Invite more villagers to live on your island
  3. Improve your island's image
- How to complete these steps will be outlined below.

### Campsite
- The first thing Tom Nook will want you to do is build a campsite. He will give you the DIY for a **Campsite construction kit**, a temporary DIY that you must craft in order to place the campsite. The recipe calls for:
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/DIYWoodNormal.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Wood</b></li>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/DIYWoodSoft.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Softwood</b></li>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/DIYWoodHard.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Hardwood</b></li>
    <li>15 <span><img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/OreIron.png" id="inv-icon"></span> <b>Iron Nuggets</b><br></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
- Once crafted you may place the campsite wherever you see fit. You can move it later if you decide you don't like it's placement.
- In 2 days, your campsite will have it's first visitor! This visitor will be a **smug** villager and they are *required* to be invited in order to progress the story.
  - If you don't like your camper, you can always let them move out later on.

### More Villagers
Now the next step is to get 2 more villagers to move in to your island!
With your first campsite visitor now part of your residents, you are now free to find other villagers how you see fit, but in all cases, you'll first need an empty plot, you can get one from Tom Nook by asking him "About selling some land", this will cost you 10,000 bells and you will get a housing kit you'll need to place somewhere on your island. Once such a plot is ready on your island, your possibilities for inviting a villager are as following:
- Find a villager on mystery island: if you ask Orville at the airport to visit a mystery island, you'll see a random villager on said island. If you want them on your island, just talk to them and accept to invite them when the option appear... Or simply ignore them if you don't want them. You can visit as many mystery island as you want until you find a villager you like.

{: .caution}
Once you invite a villager from a mystery island, no more will appear for the day, even if you have an empty plot for them.

- Invite a villager from the campsite: on random days, someone will visit the campsite. If you want that villager to live on your island, you can talk to them until they accept to move in. They might ask you to play a little game before accepting, but even if you lose, you'll never be locked out of that villager and you can keep talking to them until they give you another chance.
- Similarly, you can summon a villager to the campsite by scanning their Amiibo at the NookStop. For them to accept to move in, you'll have to invite them on three different days and give them each time the DIY item they request, and if you don't know that DIY, they'll give you one copy of the card.

{: .note}
Campers, both random or summoned with an Amiibo, have an exception to the empty plot needed rule: if you already have 10 housing plots, and all 10 are already occupied or at least claimed, the camper can replace a villager currently living on your island. Random campers choose someone random, but campers summoned with an Amiibo give you the choice of who to replace.

- Invite a villager leaving from another island: If a villager is about to leave on another island (players say they are "in boxes", meaning they'll be cleaning their house and packing their stuff in cardboard boxes), you can visit said island and talk to that villager to invite them to yours.
- Let the game's randomness handle it: if you leave an empty plot unclaimed, the game will assign it to a villager waiting in your move-in queue (see [this link](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#what-is-the-voidwhere-do-villagers-that-automatically-fill-my-empty-plots-come-from) for more details), or if that queue is empty, it has an increasing chance each day to generate a random villager for the plot.
