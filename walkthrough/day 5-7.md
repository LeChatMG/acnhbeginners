# Tasks
## Campsite


Now you should have 5 villagers! This is your 2 starting villagers and 3 plots you built. After everyone has moved in to the island Tom Nook will give you the campsite building kit. This is where every often a Camper will come and you can potentially make them move to your island! Find a spot to build the campsite and press <span class="icon-A"></span> and you will have 2 options:
- Imagine it
- This is the spot


Similar to building bridges "Imagine it" will show you how the campsite will look in that spot and "This is the spot" will place it! The first Camper will be your 6th villager!
{: .note} You may have to wait a few days before you see a camper pop up in the campsite! Tom Nook will announce when you have a camper in your campsite.

- Does the first camper have to move in to my island?
  - Yes they do! No matter who the first camper is they will have to move in, but don't worry if you want you can get rid of them later! See [here](https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/moveout.html) for how to get rid of them!

See [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#how-often-does-someone-visit-my-campsite) for more information on the campsite!

## More Villagers


Now the next step is to get 2 more villagers to move in to your island! -- **needs to be finished**
## Upgrading the Resident Services


The Resident Services is the tent that you go to talk to Tom Nook at the moment! To activate the upgrade you need to have built the Nook's Cranny and have 8 villagers! See [above](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%205-7/#more-villagers) for more villagers and [Day 4](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%204/) for more guidance on the Nook's Cranny. After this Tom Nook will announce that the Resident Services is closed for upgrading! The next day the construction will be complete!


## Isabelle


Isabelle is an NPC you meet once the upgrade of teh Resident Services is complete! Tom Nook will introsduce you to her and explain that she will take some of his responsibiities. Isabelle also adds some options for you! After the announcement of completing the build has been complete then head over to the Resident services. Isballe is on the right and Tom Nook is on the left. Approach the seat in front of Isabelle and sit down. Isabelle will then greet you and present you with tehse options:
- Change Island tune
  - This changes your island tune! This can be heard when you talk to any NPC or Villager! Villagers can also be found singing this at your **Resident Services Plaza**
- Change Island Flag
  - You can choose one of your custom designs for an Island Flag. This will be seen ontop of the **Resident Services building** and outside the **Airport.**
- Report a Villager
  - To report a villager you get 2 option: **"Report the way they dress"** and **"Report the way they talk"**
  - **Report the way they dress:** This will reset teh villagers custom clothes designs from **your island** in their inventory.
  - **Report the way they talk:** This will reset their catchphrase the villager have.
  
  
{: .note}
**Reporting the way a villager dresses** will **NOT** remove custom clothes that the villager has if they were brought from another island. This function will only remove custom clothes from **your island**. These custom designs from your island need to be **displayed in the ables sisters shop**.
**Reporting the way a villager talks** will **NOT** remove any *nickanames* the villagers have for you or their *greetings!*


Isabelle will now also be giving you your daily announcments instead of Tom Nook.
