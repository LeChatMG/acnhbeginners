# Days 5-7
Welcome to Days 5-7! The following days will be clumped together as there is much less structure and these objectives can be completed any time before the end of the week. Before proceeding, please make sure you've completed the following objectives:
- Crafted and placed your first bridge
- Placed and furnished three plots

If you have not completed any of this please see [Day 4](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhbeginners/walkthrough/day%204/) for further guidance.

# Tasks
## Customization workshop
- Now that you've furnished the plots, Tom Nook should make an announcement about his **customization workshop**. Customization allows you to change the look of some items.
  - *Note:* Not every item is customizable.
- Customization is relatively straightforward, all you need to do is bring the **item you want to customize** and the required number of **customization kits** to a workbench and select "customize something".
- Tom Nook will give you 50 customization kits for you to use and experiment with.

## Harvey and his island
- In the next couple days you might see a hippie dog walking around your island. Talking to him will prompt him to introduce himself as Harvey (Harv for short) and invite you to visit his island.
- Harv's island is also called **Photopia**, and you can use the house on his island to stage photos for fun.

{: .note}
Harv's island is also where you obtain **villager and NPC posters**. You can do this by spawning your villagers into Photopia (select the tab with the cat head on it when in design mode), or by scanning in a villager/NPC's [Amiibo](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/villagers/#what-are-amiibos-who-has-an-amiibo).

## Upgraded Resident Services and Isabelle
- When all 3 of your brand new villagers have moved in, Tom Nook will make an announcement that he is upgrading the Resident Services tent into a building -- hooray! 
- There's nothing you have to do to proceed with this, but the building will be down and inaccessible for a day. If you have an ABD streak, it will not be affected by the construction day, so don't worry about losing your miles.

### Isabelle
- Isabelle is an NPC you meet once the upgrade of the Resident Services is complete. Tom Nook will introduce her during announcements and explain that she will take some of his responsibilities.
- Isabelle also adds some new options for you. Visit [here](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#isabelle) to learn more about Isabelle and what she does. 

### Construction counter 
- You now have access to Tom Nook's **construction counter**. By sitting in front of Tom Nook's desk, you may now:
  - Ask to build inclines
  - Ask to build ramps
  - Ask to move buildings (everything except the Resident Services building can be moved)

## Able Sisters
talk about inviting mabel here.

<!-- tentative organization for now. -->
# Project K
- The activation of this quest signals the tail end of the tutorial. Once you have finished this quest, the tutorial will be over and you will not have any more quests given by Tom Nook to complete.
- Speak to Tom Nook at the construction counter and ask him "What should I do?". He will explain that he has a vision for the island, and that he would like to invite [K.K. Slider](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/npc/#kk-slider) to perform on your humble island.
- Project K is split into three phases, all of which need to be completed in order for K.K. Slider to visit:
  1. Build a Campsite
  2. Invite more villagers to live on your island
  3. Improve your island's image
- How to complete these steps will be outlined below.

### Campsite
- The first thing Tom Nook will want you to do is build a campsite. He will give you the DIY for a **Campsite construction kit**, a temporary DIY that you must craft in order to place the campsite. The recipe calls for:
  - 15 **Wood**
  - 15 **Softwood**
  - 15 **Hardwood**
  - 15 **Iron nugget**
- Once crafted you may place the campsite wherever you see fit. You can move it later if you decide you don't like it's placement.
- In 2 days, your campsite will have it's first visitor! This visitor will be a **smug** villager and they are *required* to invite in order to progress the story.
  - If you don't like your camper, you can always let them move out later on.

### More Villagers
Now the next step is to get 2 more villagers to move in to your island! -- **needs to be finished**

### Island Rating
u can basically just link https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/island-dev/rating/ here. no need to repeat ourselves. :craughig:
