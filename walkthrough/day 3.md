# Nooks Cranny completion
Finish gathering resources for the Nooks cranny!
- 30 **Wood**
- 30 **Softwood**
- 30 **Hardwood**
- 30 **Iron Nuggets**
*Tip: hit rocks every day. You have 6 rocks on your island in total giving you 48 chances to get iron nuggets! Same with fruit trees! Shake them every day.*
Don't stress if you haven't finished this by today! Continue this through the days! Play the game at your own pace.

# Mystery Islands!
If you’ve collected all the materials from your island but still need more, you could go to a mystery island by buying a Nook Miles Ticket (NMT) from the nook stop and going to the airport. On mystery islands, you will find rocks, trees, flowers and shells making them a great way to get more resources.

# Tasks

## Your First Bridge!
If you talk to Tom Nook, he will mention more people wanting to move to your island and give you the bridge construction kit. To craft it see below:

- 4 **Log Stakes**
- 4 **Stone**
- 4 **Clay**
*Note:* Log Stakes are a DIY recipe Tom Nook added automatically to your DIY list, you'll need 3 **wood** to craft each one


To place it open your pockets and press <span class="icon-A"></span> on it! Then you can press <span class="icon-A"></span> to choose "Place". You will have 2 options. “Imagine it” and “This is the spot”.

## New Villagers!
After you place the bridge Tom Nook will give you three plots to place, these are where new villagers will live. These villagers will be
- Peppy
- Lazy
- Normal


Once you place two of the plots you will unlock the **ladder** DIY recipe and be able to climb up cliffs.


For these plots you'll need to prepare some items for the house before villagers can move into them! You will find a box attached to the plots with a list of interior and exterior items you'll need to craft. Interior items go inside the box once crafted and exterior items need to be placed near the outside within two tiles of the plot. Press <span class="icon-A"></span> on the box to see which items you need to craft!
