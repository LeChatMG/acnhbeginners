# Day 1
1. Choose an Island!
- Choose an island layout! There are many to pick from but you only get a set of 4 at first!
- Don't like any of those?
  - Don't worry! Don't save your game and close it. Reopening yopur game will give you a new set of 4 island layouts to choose from!
2. Choose your hemisphere!
- What is a hemisphere?
  - The earth is split in 2! The top side is called "Northern hemisphere" and the bottom is called "Southern hemisphere"
- Which hemisphere am I?
  - If you really don't know search it up on your best friend google or a web browser!
  - Southern Hemisphere: Australia, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay etc
  - Northern hemisphere: Northern part of South America, Europe, the northern two-thirds of Africa and most of Asia
- Which hemisphere is the better one to choose?
  - That's your opinion! Bothe hemisphere's receive the same events and characters just different seasons!
