# Day 1

![Timmy Tommy Welcome](/acnhbeginners/assets/tt_welcome.jpg)

## Setup
Welcome to the game! Upon startup, Timmy and Tommy will greet you and help you with setting up your island. They will walk you through the following steps:

### Choosing an island layout

![Map Layout](/acnhbeginners/assets/tt_maps.jpg)

- There will be 4 to pick from.
  - *Note:* If you do not like any of these options, feel free to quit the game and restart it! 4 new options will appear. You can continue to do this until you find a layout you are happy with.
- This step is important as it determines a couple of permanent (unchangeable) fixtures on your island: Resident Services (leaf icon), estuaries, the airport, and your "secret" (Northern) beach. 


**maybe we should add an image here for the permanant ones?**

### Choosing your hemisphere

![Hemispheres](/acnhbeginners/assets/hemispheres.png)

- Your **hemisphere** is the half of the Earth you live on in relation to the equator. The equator is an imaginary line that sections the earth in half. The top half (above the equator) is called the "Northern Hemisphere" and the bottom half (below the equator) is called the "Southern Hemisphere"
- If you don't know your hemisphere, search it up on Google! Here are some examples:
  - Southern Hemisphere: Australia, New Zealand, Chile, most of Indonesia, etc.
  - Northern hemisphere: Canada, United States of America, all of Europe, Japan, India, etc.
- Is one hemisphere better than the other?
  - Both hemispheres receive the exact same events, items, and characters, just during different seasons. We recommend choosing the hemisphere you live in but it is up to you!

Hemisphere Season Correlation:

| Northern | Southern |
|:--------:|:--------:|
|  Summer  |  Winter  |
|  Autumn  |  Spring  |
|  Winter  |  Summer  |
|  Spring  |  Autumn  |

## Arriving at your island!
After you have setup most the steps above with Timmy and Tommy you are now sent on the plane to your island! See below for the next steps:

### Meeting the first residents!

- You will meet your first residents on the island. These can be different for everyone! One of them will be a "jock" villager. Another will be a "sisterly/uchi" villager.
*add a list of jocks and sisterly/uchi villagers*

### Set up your tent!
- Talk to Tom Nook! He will give you a kit to set up ypur tent on the island! Choose wisely, you won't be able to change your placement for a while!

### Set your villagers tents!
- After placing your tent go talk to your villagers. They will ask you help in placing their tent. You have 2 options there 1. "looks good there" and 2. "i'll choose a place for you".
  - Option 1: Places your villagers tent where they had planned it to be!
  - Option 2: This gives you their tent kit and you can place it where you would like!
