# Tasks

Your First Bridge!
If you talk to Tom Nook, he will mention more people wanting to move to your island and give you the bridge construction kit, (you need 12x wood, 4x stone, 4x clay, to craft it). 

New Villagers!
After you place the bridge he will give you three plots to place, these are where new villagers will live, a peppy, lazy and normal type. Once you place two of the plots you will unlock the ladder recipe and be able to climb up the cliffs to the other levels of your island. You will need to craft some items for the plots, the interior items go in the box attached to the side and to add the items, face the box and click “A”.The exterior items just need to be placed around the plot.
